# Allow 2 Zoom

Firefox extension to remove constraints on websites that don't allow to zoom in. This extension will remove 
[maximum-scale](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag#maximum-scale) and 
[user-scalable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag#user-scalable) from
the [viewport](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag) meta tag, thus allowing to zoom in into the content.
